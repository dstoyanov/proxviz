                             proxviz

This tool was developed as a part of Dimo Stoyanov's master thesis 
project at VU University Amsterdam. It is used for visualization of
proximity graphs.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the project can be compiled by typing
doxygen proxviz.cfg
in the src folder.


Compilation
-----------

Type the following commands in the src folder:
qmake
make

The executable will be created in the same folder.


Application Input
-----------------

Sample input for the application can be found in the datasets folder.
The application expects 3 types of input files:
    - Ubisense trace log file (datasets/quiz_round2/
    ubisense_quiz_round2_enhanced.log is an example for such a file);
    - One nodelog per badge (the format of the nodelogs can be seen
    in the datasets/quiz_round2/node000016.nodedat file);
    - The mapping between Ubisense and badge ids in a file called 
    dictionary.dat.

The application will display an error message if any of the 3 types
of files is missing.

Proxviz can visualize data in real-time as well as prerecorded data streams.
The default location for real-time data streams is datasets/quiz_round2.
It is stored in the default_reading_location variable in the GLWidget class.
The location of prerecorded data streams is chosen in run time.
